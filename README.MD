This is a BDD framework. I've use Cucumber and Gherkin to design and prioritise the test cases. Selenium Webdriver is used to interact with the web element.

I've used Page Object Model design pattern for managing the web element locators and Maven build tool to manage dependencies

Junit is used to run the project

SoftAssertion is used for validation (Please note I’ve used SoftAssertion instead of hard assertion because I know my test will fail and I don’t want it to stop the test execution). 
Cucumber report for the Automation report
